Navigate this web page to understand the impacts of the clean energy transition on different parts of the Central Coast!
<br>
In December 2022, three global companies won the rights to develop offshore wind farms off the coast of San Luis Obispo County. The clean energy output could power 3.5 million homes, marking a significant step towards Californiaâ€™s carbon neutrality goals. It will also lead to the creation of a new economy around clean energy in the region, with employment opportunities for residents in the area. At the same time, however, the Central Coast stands to lose reliable, unionized fossil fuel jobs as the region shifts to a decarbonized energy supply. Estimates of where, how many, and what type of energy jobs will be gained (and lost) during this transition will inform conversations and policy decisions around offshore wind installation and the community investment funding.
